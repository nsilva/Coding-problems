Codign problems and step by step solutions in Python/Jupyter Notebooks

1. Find array subsequence
Given two non-empty array, write a function to find if a array b is a subsequence of array a.
A subsequece is a subset of another array where elements are necessarily adjacent but are in the same order.
For example, 1, 3, -5 is a subsequence of 9, 1, 4, 3, -5.
1. Find array sum
Given a list of numbers j, and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
For example, given 10, 15, 3, 7 and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
